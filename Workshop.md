# Bigger Train Stations

This mod adds more options to train stations: more tracks & longer platforms, but also a very short platform and pretty much everything in between has been added ;)

## Features

* stations with up to 1000m length
* new 40m stations
* build in steps of 40m instead of 80m (e.g. 120m and 200m are now possible)
* more tracks: build anything from 1 to 48 tracks
* comes with free cake. here you go: ðŸŽ‚

## Compatibility

* this mod can be safely added and removed at any time. Your savegames will not be affected.
* adds options to all vanilla stations (you will still get the same stations, there are just way more options to pick from)
* adds options to [Curved train stations](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=854664535), [Sloped train stations](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=824307738) and other modded stations that do not alter the track configuration
* Tested with all train station mods currently available in the Workshop. Not compatible with: "[Longer Train Stations v5](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799390578)", "[Longer Train Stations (400 m)](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=795434891)" and "[Cargo station without middle ramp](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=797527610)".

*Note*: Compatibility issues usually arise, because another mod is trying to do the same thing as this one (i.e. adjusting properties of the vanilla train stations). Having incompatible mods active won't cause crashes and it won't damage your savegames, but this mod may not work as expected.

## Random notes

* ~~this mod also fixes a bug in TpF which causes the ground not get properly aligned if a station with a second street connection is built~~ - has been fixed
* the allowed number of tracks for the passenger through station and the cargo through station was reduced due to an issue in Transport Fever that caused error messages to appear (e.g. "Terminals are not properly"). 
* Your feedback is very welcome. If you encounter any issues, please attach your log files from `Steam/userdata/<userid>/446800/local/crash_dump`
