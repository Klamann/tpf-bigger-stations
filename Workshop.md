# Bigger Stations

*abstract*

## Features

* more length options: 40m to 1000m, in steps of 40m
* more tracks: from 1 to 40
* comes with free cake. here you go: ðŸŽ‚

## Compatibility

* mod can be safely added and removed at any time (does not alter game state)
* adds options to all vanilla stations
* adds options to all modded stations that do not alter the track configuration (e.g. foo, but not bar)
* works with all station mods currently available in the workshop, except for "[Longer Train Stations v5](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799390578)"

**Warning**: not compatible with "[Longer Train Stations v5](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799390578)" - both mods use a similar method to change things, so they don't get along very well. This is not a bug and cannot be fixed, it's just how things work.
