# Bigger Stations

*abstract*

## Features

* build stations with up to 1000m length
* adds a 40m station and allows you to build in steps of 40m (e.g. 120m or 200m are now possible)
* more tracks: build anything from 1 to 48 tracks
* fixes a bug in TpF where the ground does not get properly aligned when building stations with a second street connection
* comes with free cake. here you go: ðŸŽ‚

## Compatibility

* mod can be safely added and removed at any time (does not alter game state)
* adds options to all vanilla stations
* adds options to all modded stations that do not alter the track configuration (e.g. foo, but not bar)
* works with all station mods currently available in the workshop, except for "[Longer Train Stations v5](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799390578)"

**Warning**: not compatible with "[Longer Train Stations v5](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799390578)" - both mods use a similar method to change things, so they don't get along very well. This is not a bug and cannot be fixed, it's just how things work.
