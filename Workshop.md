# Bigger Train Stations

This mod adds more options to train stations: more tracks & longer platforms, but also a very short platform and pretty much everything in between has been added ;)

## Features

* stations with up to 1000m length
* new 40m stations
* build in steps of 40m instead of 80m (e.g. 120m and 200m are now possible)
* more tracks: build anything from 1 to 48 tracks
* comes with free cake. here you go: ðŸŽ‚

## Compatibility

* this mod can be safely added and removed at any time
* adds options to all vanilla stations (you will still get the same stations, there are just way more options to pick from)
* adds options to all modded stations that do not alter the track configuration (e.g. [Sloped train stations](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=824307738))
* works with all station mods currently available in the workshop, except for "[Longer Train Stations v5](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799390578)"

**Warning**: not compatible with "[Longer Train Stations v5](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799390578)" - both mods use a similar method to change things, so they don't get along very well. Having both mods active does not cause crashes, but this mod simply won't work. This is not a bug and cannot be fixed.

## Random notes

* this mod also fixes a bug in TpF which causes the ground not get properly aligned if a station with a second street connection is built
* Your feedback is very welcome. If you encounter any issues, please attach your log files from `Steam/userdata/<userid>/446800/local/crash_dump`
